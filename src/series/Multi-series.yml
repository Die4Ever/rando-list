comment: "Crossover Randomizer) - [Beta version](https://beta.samus.link/)---## What\
    \ is this list?Randomizers are game modifications and utilities that randomly\
    \ arranges original game data in a way that significantly increase their replayability.\
    \ Their randomization are applied before or when starting a new game in order\
    \ to effectively generate many different games to experience based off the originals.\
    \ They are also designed to prevent new unwinnable states to the game, or at the\
    \ very least make such issues extremely unlikely or have easily-applicable non-destructive\
    \ workarounds.Randomizers may feature major gameplay tweaks to accomodate possible\
    \ randomized changes, or other additional minor improvements. However, a game\
    \ modification or utility that may change any other gameplay element and which\
    \ cannot be disabled would not be considered a randomizer, as the modified game\
    \ would become closer to a custom game instead of a randomized one.This list is\
    \ an exhaustive list of all known freely-available video game randomizers that\
    \ are playable by the general public and not bundled with the game they randomize,\
    \ regardless of their fun factor. The goal of this project is to give positive\
    \ exposure to randomizers that players of their original games may have missed\
    \ otherwise. It was originally created by [Guillaume Fortin-Debigar\xE9](https://www.debigare.com/)\
    \ in 2016, and maintained by him up until 2024, when it became an [open source\
    \ community project](https://github.com/video-game-randomizers/rando-list).In\
    \ order to prevent the list from being polluted with randomizers that do not conform\
    \ to the above, the following is not considered sufficient for inclusion:Randomizers\
    \ are listed by the games they randomize and grouped by game series, along with\
    \ the randomizer's name (or the primary creators' names if it is too generic)\
    \ in parentheses, along with any additional documentation whenever necessary.The\
    \ following rules are used to determine the game name showed in the list:## Can\
    \ I help?This list would not be what it is today without the amazing help of the\
    \ gaming community! If you would like to contribute in any way, including submitting\
    \ a video game randomizer valid for inclusion that is not already listed, please\
    \ join the [Video Games Randomizer Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/YREMzGQ3gd),\
    \ the official Discord server for this page.If you are a developer, the [code\
    \ repository for this page](https://github.com/video-game-randomizers/rando-list)\
    \ is also available on GitHub. Feel free to submit pull requests and/or join the\
    \ Discord server to discuss with the other maintainers!## I want more!You can\
    \ chat with other randomizer enthusiasts on the [Video Games Randomizer Discord\
    \ server](https://discord.com/invite/YREMzGQ3gd), a Discord Community Server originally\
    \ created specifically for this page.You can look for the [Randomizer tag on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/directory/all/tags/Randomizer)\
    \ to easily find channels streaming live randomizer video content.Many popular\
    \ randomizers have progression trackers available. [EmoTracker](https://emotracker.net/)\
    \ is a popular tool that hosts a large collection of them.For those interested\
    \ in creating randomizers, you can listen to the [Making a Randomizer panel from\
    \ Awesome Games Done Quick 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGIDzGvsrV8)\
    \ explaining the process in detail. [ROMHacking.net](https://www.romhacking.net/)\
    \ is also a great resource with plenty of technical information and tools for\
    \ hacking video games in general. Frameworks such as [randomtools-js](https://github.com/stochaztic/randomtools-js)\
    \ and [Simple Randomizer Maker](https://github.com/Mips96/SimpleRandomizerMaker)\
    \ may also help for development purposes.For those that perfer an original game\
    \ experience but still want to experience a randomized challenge, [Final Fantasy\
    \ Five Four Job Fiesta](https://www.fourjobfiesta.com/freerun.php), [Hitman Roulette](https://thekotti.github.io/about.html)\
    \ and [Scenario Generator](https://scenariogenerator.net/faq) can generate interesting\
    \ rulesets with randomized goals for many classic video games.While this list\
    \ is focused on third-party video game randomizers, there are also many official\
    \ video game randomizers out there. Most notably, the unlockable item randomizer\
    \ included in the Nintendo 64 version of Resident Evil 2 is believed to be the\
    \ very first item randomizer ever.Note that randomizer variants also exist for\
    \ tabletop games as well, such as [Fischer Random Chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fischer_random_chess)\
    \ and [Monopoly Randomizer](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2410918/monopoly-randomizer)."
